# Full Stack Drills

## Introduction

Quickly work through all major areas of the full stack so you can see it all come together: 
 - Client-side a.k.a. Frontend (React)
 - Server-side a.k.a Backend (Express, and Database (MySQL).

The steps below are guidelines. After doing this a few times, challenge yourself to create your own application without any directions. If you feel fluent enough, think about adding additional features / CSS


## Goal

After completing these practice drills, you should be able to quickly build and work in any ExpressJS application. 

Building a basic CRUD app should be mostly muscle memory.

## Getting started

**How to perform this activity:**

Once you have done the setup, you will be working through parts 1-3. You should give yourself a day to work through it all. Once you have finished, you should delete everything and start over.

On the second rebuild: Do not reference code you already wrote for this assignment! Instead, rely on DOCUMENTATION and your CHEATSHEET. If you have completed part 3 in a timely manner, proceed to part 4.

--If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes, open a HELPDESK ticket--

**Setup:**

- Navigate to the root directory
- Run `npm run install-all`
- To start your react app run `npm run start:react`
- Before starting your server make sure to change your database configuration inside of queries.s
- To seed your database run `npm run seed`
- To start your server run `npm run start:server`

**Note:**

If you run in to WEBPACK or BABEL issues please get help. This activity is not designed for you to worry about that right now.

## Part 1: Server API

Objectives _(read this carefully)_:

- Create a server that responds to the specified restful routes
- Each route responds back with **dummy data for now**

Technologies:

- Node
- Express
- NPM
- Git

_ROUTES (PART 1)_

| METHOD | PATH           | DESCRIPTION                                  |
| ------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /employees     | respond with string "all the employees"      |
| GET    | /employees/:id | respond with string "single employee"        |

## Part 2: MySQL Queries

- Connect your server to your database using MySQLJS (mysql javascript)
- Complete the Routes in the route table (use the queries.js helper functions)

Technologies:

- MySQL
- MySQLJS
- Postman

_ROUTES:_

| METHOD | PATH           | DESCRIPTION                                                |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /employees     | respond with all the employees                             |
| GET    | /employees/:id | respond with single employee, based on req.params.id        |

## Part 3: ReactJS

In your frontend folder:

- It should allow a users to do the following from their web browser:
  - View all employees from the server
  - View a specific employee from the server
- You will need to use AJAX (Fetch, Axios, etc) to allow your client side code to talk to your server.
- You can create as many React components as you want

You've already created the endpoints below, now you need to use AJAX to communicate to them and get the info you need to the client-side code:

| METHOD | PATH           | DESCRIPTION                                                |
| ------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| GET    | /employees     | respond with all the employees                             |
| GET    | /employees/:id | respond with single employee, based on req.params.id        |

## Part 4: Bonus - Full CRUD  

**(DO THIS ONLY ON THE SECOND RUN)**

Handle these additional routes in your server, they should modify the database accordingly:

| METHOD | PATH           | DESCRIPTION                                 |
| ------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| POST   | /employees     | inserts new employeee record from req.body  |
| PATCH  | /employees/:id | update an employee record from req.body     |
| DELETE | /employees/:id | delete an employee record                   |

Create the appropriate interface in your React app so that users can make AJAX (e.g. Axios, Fetch, $.Ajax, etc) requests to the routes above and then see the changes render in their web browser.
